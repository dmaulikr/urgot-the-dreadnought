# Urgot the Dreadnought

### Description
This is an iOS game using the character Urgot from the game League of Legends. It is a 2D platformer based around either shooting the minions (enemies) that spawn or using the character's proprietary abilities to kill them.

I don't intend to be infringing on any copyright, and will not release this game anywhere without Riot Games' express permission.
